        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Master's student in Computer Science at Northeastern University — Silicon Valley, with proficient technical skills in Python, Java, C, SQL, and more. I have hands-on experience in back-end engineering, full-stack web development, NLP, and cloud computing, demonstrated through various projects and my previous internship at Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
        <p>At AWS, I built an end-to-end automation framework for EC2 instance reservations, saving 5 hours per week of engineering time and reducing on-call anxiety. The project featured a fully automated workflow and an interactive CLI tool with alarm, notification, reservation, and monitoring capabilities, using Guice and Mockito framework. I also integrated various AWS services and APIs, including Safe Dynamic Configuration (SDC), Step Functions, EventBridge Scheduler and Simple Notification Service (SNS).</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical expertise, my prior background in linguistics and public communication has honed my ability to solve complex, cross-functional problems and collaborate effectively with diverse teams. I’m eager to leverage my skills in software engineering to create impactful solutions.</p>
